## üöÄ Getting Started

#### üîê Authentication / Authorization

Each endpoint requires prior authentication based on bearer token. This token can be obtained after signing up and/or logging and it will be needed as authorization header in every request you make.

**Register**
```
mutation Register {
    register(email: "test@example.com", password: "1234567890") {
        user {
            id
            email
            createdAt
        }
        success
        errors {
            fullMessages
        }
    }
}
```

**Login**
```
mutation Login {
    login(email: "test@example.com", password: "1234567890") {
        errors
        success
        token
    }
}
